##Data Science Capstone Project

The objective of this project is to build a **predictive text app** that is able to predict the next word of the text the user enters.  

To build this app, we used:

- A large corpus of text from [HC Corpora](www.corpora.heliohost.org)
- **Natural Language Processing** methods

This project is part of the **Data Science Capstone** from **Johns Hopkins University** and **SwiftKey** (company building smart keyboards using predictive text analytics).

The app is available on [ShinyApps.io](https://stephaniecnvs.shinyapps.io/Next_Word_Prediction/).  

Source codes (*ui.R*, *server.R* and *word_prediction.R*) are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/stephaniecan/data_science_capstone/tree/master/Next_Word_Prediction)

The related R Presentation is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/Stephaniecnvs/Next-word-prediction-app).  

The Milestone Report (Exploratory Data Analysis) is available at [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/Stephaniecnvs/NLP-milestone-report).
